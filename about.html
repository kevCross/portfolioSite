		<h1>A LIL' BIT ABOUT ME</h1>
		<h2>A SHORT BIO</h2>
		<p>
		<span class="red">I am a Web Developer and Web Designer.</span>I have been to school for<span class="red">Interactive Media Design, Graphic Design, Art and Printing.</span>I have been making sites since the early 90's. 
		</p>
		<h2>BRIEF VISION</h2>
		<p>
		I believe a site should be a reflection of you and/or your business. Every business has a<span class="blue">personality, a identity, a brand.</span>I take pride in finding and encompassing that and bringing it to life for your future and current clients to see<span class="blue">you how you desired to be viewed.</span>
		</p>
		<h2>BRIEF MISSION</h2>
		<p>
		My mission is to make sites that showcase your site like a<span class="red">grand re-opening</span>to those who may never heard of your company, and for those who are seeing your site for the first time, will be blown away by the site and its<span class="blue">performance, responsiveness, and interactivity.</span>
